This repository holds the Software Requirements Specification for an Online
Stamp Ordering Website. It is written in LaTeX, which can be compiled into 
PDF. This simplifies managing the layout of the document so that more time 
can be spent on the content.

The "provided-resources" directory holds various documents provided by Dr. 
Seaman that describe the requirements for this project and some examples of 
good and bad work.

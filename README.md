SRS by Team Moon Moon
=====================

For CS3398 with Dr. Seaman at Texas State University, Spring 2014. 

This repository holds the Software Requirements Specification for an Online
Stamp Ordering Website. It is written in LaTeX, which can be compiled into 
PDF. This simplifies managing the layout of the document so that more time 
can be spent on the content.

The "provided-resources" directory holds various documents provided by Dr. 
Seaman that describe the requirements for this project and some examples of 
good and bad work.

The "release" directory holds snapshots of the PDF over time. Ideally, there 
should not be too many different snapshots, as the PDF is a binary file that 
takes up the same amount of space for every change, no matter how small. If 
you want a local copy of the PDF at any given state, just look at the 
compilation instructions.

\item Team Moon Moon Never Makes No Mistakes.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Introduction}

Team Moon Moon has been tasked with developing a SRS for their Software 
Engineering class at Texas State University. If Team Moon Moon doesn't do 
this project, Team Moon Moon will fail D: Team Moon Moon wants to 
graduate already and doesn't feel like taking this class again.

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this project is to get our C. Because C's get degrees!

\section{Project Scope and Product Features}

BLAH BLAH BLAH

\section{Defintions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}

What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

\section{References}

OMG OMG OMG

\section{Overview}

Aren't ``Introduction'' and ``Overview'' kinda the same thing? Just sayin'...

\chapter{Overall Description}

Many description. Much adjective. Wow.

\section{Product Perspective}

Such perspective. So edgy.

\section{Product Functions}

BRO DO YOU EVEN FUNCTION?

\subsection{Register New User}

Lol please shoot me now nobody does software development like this anymore.

\subsection{View Account}

DAE hate waterfall?

\section{User Characteristics}

TO THE MOON!!!

\section{Constraints}

Batman has no constraints.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

I'm starting to run out of steam here guys.

\chapter{Specific Requirements}

As opposed to general requirements.

\section{External Interface Requirements}

aryweguiahergearpguhestrgperasguheasrgpewuhr

\subsection{System Interfaces}

This product will interface with a Gibson. You know? Like, supercomputers 
they use to do physics and search for oil? Wouldn't you love to get one of 
those Gibsons?

\subsection{User Interfaces}

CLI fo LYFE. Firefox is for nubs. Real haxors use lynx!

\subsection{IN YOUR FACES}

Self-explanatory.

\section{Functional Requirements}

Ok. Now I'm really running low on ideas.

\subsection{Account Registration}

PLEASE GIVE US YOUR EMAIL SO WE CAN SPAM YOU! I mean... 
OFFER YOU EXCLUSIVE PROMOTIONS ON INSIDER DEALS!

\subsection{Account Login}

Won't somebody please log in to my blog?

\section{Performance Requirements}

Don't fail.

\section{Logical Structure of the Data}

That would imply ``logic'' and ``structure,'' neither of which are 
currently present. The logic is back-ordered and the structure was 
never there to begin with.

\section{Design Constraints}

Why would we put design constraints all the way at the bottom? You'd think 
the design constraints might illuminate pretty much all of the subsequent 
design decisions that were made and expounded upon in the entire SRS...

\section{Software System Attributes}

Is it at-tri-bute? Or a-trib-ute? Because one is a noun and one is a verb. 
Yeah, it's kinda the English language's way of saying FUCK YOU to foreigners.

% add other chapters and sections to suit

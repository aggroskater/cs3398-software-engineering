\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to present a detailed description of the
speciﬁcations and the requirements for a postage printing website. It will
explain the purpose and features of the system, the interfaces of the system,
what the system will do, the constraints under which it must operate, and how
the system will react to interactions. This document is intended for both the
stakeholders and the developers of the system.

\section{Project Scope and Product Features}

The objective of this project is to create and implement a website for printing
mailing labels containing USPS postage. The website will be used primarily by
registered users. The website will allow users to: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Create and maintain individual secured accounts
\item Buy/print postage labels
\item List postage purchase history
\item Check account balance
\item Calculate postage rates
\item Track packages
\item Request refunds
\item Check if an address is valid
\end{itemize}

\section{Defintions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations}

At this time, there are no specialized terms in need of definition.

\section{References}

Specifications. IEEE Computer Society, 1998.

\section{Overview}

The second section, the Overall Description, of this document gives an overview
of the products functionality. It describes the informal requirements and is
used to establish a context for the requirements specification in the third
section.

The third section, Requirements Specification, of this document is written
primarily for the developers. It describes details of product functionality. 

\chapter{Overall Description}

This chapter provides an overview of the software product from the perspective 
of the functions that the user is expected to have available to him.

\section{Product Perspective}

The overall idea is that the user may print pre-labelled postage from a
website. The website provides an address verification service, and is licensed
by the relevant governments to sell postage that the relevant governments’
postal services will honor. This makes obtaining and labelling postage much
quicker than by traditional means, wherein one had to drive to the post office
to obtain stamps, and had no way to verify the existence of any particular
address. As well, the user can either add credit to the website or purchase
postage on a one-off basis, and can access a record of all transactions made
with the website.

\section{Product Functions}

The following subsections detail the various functions that the user of the 
software must be able to utilize.

\subsection{Create An Account}

The Create Account function shall allow a user to create a secure account. The
account will track the user’s full name, mailing address, email address, credit
card information, username and password, and the purchase history for up to two
years.

\subsection{Print Postage}

The Print Postage function shall allow the user to print postage that has been 
purchased, \emph{directly to a printer and NOT to a file.} The postage label 
will be provided upon successfully calling the UPS API, which will return an 
image suitable for printing. 

\subsection{Buy Postage}

The Buy Postage function shall allow the user to purchase postage, using
available credit on their account. Upon a successful print, the user's account 
balance is appropriately debited.

\subsection{List Postage Transactions}

The List Postage Transactions function shall allow the user to view a list of
all of the postage labels that they have printed, including the information
printed on the label, over the past two years.

\subsection{Get Postage Balance}

The Get Postage Balance function shall allow the user to obtain their current
amount in their postage buying account.

\subsection{Calculate Postage}

The Calculate Postage function shall allow the user to enter a name, address,
package type, mail class, and weight. The user shall then be able to see a
calculated postage amount to ship their package.

\subsection{Track/Confirm Package}

The track/confirm package function shall allow users to enter in a tracking
number to see the status of their package. The status of the package will be
received from USPS  and displayed to the user. 

\subsection{Login/Password Reset}

The login function shall allow account members to enter their username and
password.  When verified with the system database, users will be able to access
restricted functions. The login function shall provide users an option to
reset their password. 

\subsection{Refund Request}

The Refund Request function shall allow the user to enter a date and to select
from a list any postage purchase made on that date that they wish to refund as
long as it is not older than ten days old.

\subsection{Validate Address}

The Validate Address function shall allow the user to enter an address to
verify its validity.

\subsection{Logout}

The logout function shall allow the account user to exit out of their account
for security.

\section{User Characteristics}

Users are expected to be Internet literate and be able to navigate in a
website.

\section{Constraints}

While the system does not have any restricting hardware or software
constraints, the system does have some constraints on the user which are
described in the 2.3 User Characteristics part of this document.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}

It is assumed that the end user: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Has an Internet connection. 
\item Has a web browser able to display the website.
\item Has a printer.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Specific Requirements}

\section{External Interface Requirements}

This section details any significant interfaces that the Online 
Postage Printing Website will encounter.

\subsection{System Interfaces}

There are two main system interfaces:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The online credit card processing system. The website will 
access this system via an API to charge cards.
\item The UPS postage label API. The website will make several 
queries to the UPS' APIs in order to calculate shipping cost and 
retrieve labels.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Interfaces}

The system shall provide users access to the USPS postage printing website via
the Internet. There will be two different user interfaces that will accompany
the website: Registered users, and Non-Registered users.

Non-Registered Users: The user will be allowed to register for an account.
The user shall be allowed access only to the follow functions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create an Account
\item Track/Confirm Package
\item Validate Address
\end{enumerate}

Registered Users: The user must be logged in at all times. 
The user shall be allowed access to any of the following functions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Login
\item Print Postage
\item Buy Postage
\item List Postage Transactions
\item Get Postage Balance
\item Refund Request
\item Track/Confirm Package
\item Validate Address
\item Log out
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}

All hardware shall be required to connect to the internet.

\subsection{Software Interfaces}

There are no special software interface requirements outside of the 
APIs mentioned in the System Interfaces subsection.

\subsection{Communication Interfaces}

There are no special communications interfaces requirements.

\section{Functional Requirements}

The following subsections describe, in detail, the requirements for 
the system in order to provide each function described in section 
2.2.

\subsection{Create an Account}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The user is prompted by the system to provide the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Full Name
\item Mailing Address
\item Email Address
\item Credit Card Information (Refer to Section 3.4)
\item Unique Username
\item Password
\end{itemize}
\item Once the user has entered the required information, the system verifies
that the required attributes are present, that the email address has a valid
form, that the login name does not exist in the database, and that the password
meets the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item Must be at least 10 characters long
\item Must contain at least one letter
\item Must contain at least one digit
\item Must contain at least on special character (@,\#,\$,\%)
\end{itemize}
\item If the system detects invalid registration information (Required fields
are empty, email address does not have a valid format, the login name is
already in use, or the passwords do not match) then the system shall prompt the
user to reenter the information.  
\begin{itemize}
\item All provided information, entered by the user, should be stored in the
system (Refer to section 3.4).
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Print Postage}

The system shall...

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, ensure
\begin{enumerate}
\item that there is a valid, logged-in user requesting to buy postage.
Otherwise, redirect to the Log In function.
\end{enumerate}
\item Then, provide the user with options of what sort of postage to print 
for. Specifically, provide specific options for class and type, and permit 
the user to enter a number for weight.
\item Then, upon the user selecting a package class, type, and weight, 
request sender and recipient addresses. Proceed to the verify address function 
for each of these addresses to ensure they are valid.
\item Then, upon confirming address validity, ask user whether s/he wishes to 
add tracking numbers to the postage label.
\item Then, upon confirmation of tracking number selection (yes or no), submit 
all of the obtained data thus far to the UPS api in order to obtain a total 
cost and a shipping label and tracking number if necessary.
\item If the API call fails, the program must investigate the reason and 
intelligently inform the user as to the source of the error and its correction.
\item If the API call succeeds, present the user with the cost of the 
label. If there is sufficient credit in the user's account as indicated by the
Get Postage Balance function, continue.  Otherwise, jump to the Buy Postage
function and return.
\item Upon confirmation from the user that s/he wishes to print the label,
enter the transaction into the transaction ledger, permit the user to print the
label, and decrement the user's account balance.
\end{enumerate}
